# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Motor
Predictive Maintenance is a condition based maintenance strategy uses the actual condition of the equipment to plan what maintenance needs to be performed and when it should be carried out to prevent unplanned motor failure and unnecessary downtime that can greatly affect overall production cost.
Motors, whether used to drive conveyors, pumps, cooling fans, or any other machinery, are best viewed as core parts of “systems.” 
In this project our aim is to reduce unplanned breakdown time and prevent the occurance of motor failure which save money on reaplcements and minimize the overall production cost.
